# X0_Games Repository

## This repository contains implementations of various Tic-Tac-Toe variants, each offering unique game mechanics and challenges. The goal of this project is to explore different Tic-Tac-Toe games, including variations such as 5x5 Tic-Tac-Toe, Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe, and others. Each game is implemented in C++ and utilizes different strategies and board setups to enhance the traditional Tic-Tac-Toe experience.

## Games Included
Pyramid Tic-Tac-Toe
A variant with a pyramid-like board structure.

Four in a Row
A twist on traditional Tic-Tac-Toe, where the goal is to align four symbols instead of three.

5x5 Tic-Tac-Toe
A larger board that introduces new complexity and strategies.

Words Tic-Tac-Toe
A creative variation where players form words rather than simply aligning X’s or O’s.

Numerical Tic-Tac-Toe
A version where players place numbers, aiming for a specific total.

Misere Tic-Tac-Toe
A unique variant where the objective is to avoid winning, adding an extra layer of strategy.

Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe
A multi-level Tic-Tac-Toe game, where each cell is a smaller Tic-Tac-Toe game.

SUS Tic-Tac-Toe
A variant involving social deception, where players must figure out who is the "SUS" player.

## Game Implementations
Each game has its own header file, defining the class structure, rules, and gameplay mechanics.
The main.cpp file serves as an entry point for the games and includes the logic to initialize and run each game.
Setup
Prerequisites
C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
